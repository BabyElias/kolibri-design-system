        Use <code>KTextTruncator</code> to shorten long text while keeping it readable. It limits
        the text to a specific number of lines and adds an ellipsis (<code>...</code>) when the text
        overflows.
      </p>

      <p>By default, text truncates to one line if <code>maxLines</code> is not set.</p>

      <h3>Customizing the Number of Lines</h3>
      <p>Use <code>maxLines</code> to control the number of lines before truncation.</p>
